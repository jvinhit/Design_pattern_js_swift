New is always better!

You have most certainly dealt with copies in JavaScript before, even if you didn’t know it. Maybe you have also heard of the paradigm in functional programming that you shouldn’t modify any existing data. In order to do that, you have to know how to safely copy values in JavaScript. Today, we’ll look at how to do this while avoiding the pitfalls!

First of all, what is a copy?

A copy just looks like the old thing, but isn’t. When you change the copy, you expect the original thing to stay the same, whereas the copy changes.

In programming, we store values in variables. Making a copy means that you initiate a new variable with the same value(s). However, there is a big potential pitfall to consider: deep copying vs. shallow copying. A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable. A shallow copy means that certain (sub-)values are still connected to the original variable.

To really understand copying, you have to get into how JavaScript stores values.
Primitive data types
Primitive data types include the following:

Number — e.g. 1
String — e.g. 'Hello'
Boolean — e.g. true
undefined
null
When you create these values, they are tightly coupled with the variable they are assigned to. They only exist once. That means you do not really have to worry about copying primitive data types in JavaScript. When you make a copy, it will be a real copy. Let’s see an example:

const a = 5
let b = a // this is the copy
b = 6
console.log(b) // 6
console.log(a) // 5
By executing b = a , you make the copy. Now, when you reassign a new value to b, the value of b changes, but not of a.

Composite data types — Objects and Arrays
Technically, arrays are also objects, so they behave in the same way. I will go through both of them in detail later.

Here it gets more interesting. These values are actually stored just once when instantiated, and assigning a variable just creates a pointer (reference) to that value.

Now, if we make a copy b = a , and change some nested value in b, it actually changes a’s nested value as well, since a and b actually point to the same thing. Example:

const a = {
  en: 'Hello',
  de: 'Hallo',
  es: 'Hola',
  pt: 'Olà'
}
let b = a
b.pt = 'Oi'
console.log(b.pt) // Oi
console.log(a.pt) // Oi
In the example above, we actually made a shallow copy. This is often times problematic, since we expect the old variable to have the original values, not the changed ones. When we access it, we sometimes get an error. It might happen that you try to debug it for a while before you find the error, since a lot of developers do not really grasp the concept and do not expect that to be the error.

Let’s have a look at how we can make copies of objects and arrays.

Objects
There are multiple ways to make copies of objects, especially with the new expanding and improving JavaScript specification.

Spread operator
Introduced with ES2015, this operator is just great, because it is so short and simple. It ‘spreads’ out all of the values into a new object. You can use it as follows:

const a = {
  en: 'Bye',
  de: 'Tschüss'
}
let b = {...a}
b.de = 'Ciao'
console.log(b.de) // Ciao
console.log(a.de) // Tschüss
You can also use it to merge two objects together, for example const c = {...a, ...b} .

Object.assign
This was mostly used before the spread operator was around, and it basically does the same thing. You have to be careful though, as the first argument in the Object.assign() method actually gets modified and returned. So make sure that you pass the object to copy at least as the second argument. Normally, you would just pass an empty object as the first argument to prevent modifying any existing data.

const a = {
  en: 'Bye',
  de: 'Tschüss'
}
let b = Object.assign({}, a)
b.de = 'Ciao'
console.log(b.de) // Ciao
console.log(a.de) // Tschüss
Pitfall: Nested Objects
As mentioned before, there is one big caveat when dealing with copying objects, which applies to both methods listed above. When you have a nested object (or array) and you copy it, nested objects inside that object will not be copied, since they are only pointers / references. Therefore, if you change the nested object, you will change it for both instances, meaning you would end up doing a shallow copy again. Example:// BAD EXAMPLE

const a = {
  foods: {
    dinner: 'Pasta'
  }
}
let b = {...a}
b.foods.dinner = 'Soup' // changes for both objects
console.log(b.foods.dinner) // Soup
console.log(a.foods.dinner) // Soup
To make a deep copy of nested objects, you would have to consider that. One way to prevent that is manually copying all nested objects:

const a = {
  foods: {
    dinner: 'Pasta'
  }
}
let b = {foods: {...a.foods}}
b.foods.dinner = 'Soup'
console.log(b.foods.dinner) // Soup
console.log(a.foods.dinner) // Pasta
In case you were wondering what to do when the object has more keys than only foods , you can use the full potential of the spread operator. When passing more properties after the ...spread , they overwrite the original values, for example const b = {...a, foods: {...a.foods}} .

Making deep copies without thinking
What if you don’t know how deep the nested structures are? It can be very tedious to manually go through big objects and copy every nested object by hand. There is a way to copy everything without thinking. You simply stringify your object and parse it right after:

const a = {
  foods: {
    dinner: 'Pasta'
  }
}
let b = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(a))
b.foods.dinner = 'Soup'
console.log(b.foods.dinner) // Soup
console.log(a.foods.dinner) // Pasta
Here, you have to consider that you will not be able to copy custom class instances, so you can only use it when you copy objects with native JavaScript values inside.

Arrays
Copying arrays is just as common as copying objects. A lot of the logic behind it is similar, since arrays are also just objects under the hood.

Spread operator
As with objects, you can use the spread operator to copy an array:

const a = [1,2,3]
let b = [...a]
b[1] = 4
console.log(b[1]) // 4
console.log(a[1]) // 2
Array functions — map, filter, reduce
These methods will return a new array with all (or some) values of the original one. While doing that, you can also modify the values, which comes in very handy:

const a = [1,2,3]
let b = a.map(el => el)
b[1] = 4
console.log(b[1]) // 4
console.log(a[1]) // 2
Alternatively you can change the desired element while copying:

const a = [1,2,3]
const b = a.map((el, index) => index === 1 ? 4 : el)
console.log(b[1]) // 4
console.log(a[1]) // 2
Array.slice
This method is normally used to return a subset of the elements, starting at a specific index and optionally ending at a specific index of the original array. When using array.slice() or array.slice(0) you will end up with a copy of the original array.

const a = [1,2,3]
let b = a.slice(0)
b[1] = 4
console.log(b[1]) // 4
console.log(a[1]) // 2
Nested arrays
Similar to objects, using the methods above to copy an array with another array or object inside will generate a shallow copy. To prevent that, also use JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(someArray)) .

BONUS: copying instance of custom classes
When you are already a pro in JavaScript and you deal with your custom constructor functions or classes, maybe you want to copy instances of those as well.

As mentioned before, you cannot just stringify + parse those, as you will lose your class methods. Instead, you would want to add a custom copy method to create a new instance with all of the old values. Let’s see how that works:

class Counter {
  constructor() {
     this.count = 5
  }
  copy() {
    const copy = new Counter()
    copy.count = this.count
    return copy
  }
}
const originalCounter = new Counter()
const copiedCounter = originalCounter.copy()
console.log(originalCounter.count) // 5
console.log(copiedCounter.count) // 5
copiedCounter.count = 7
console.log(originalCounter.count) // 5
console.log(copiedCounter.count) // 7
To deal with objects and arrays that are referenced inside of your instance, you would have to apply your newly learned skills about deep copying! I will just add a final solution for the custom constructor copy method to make it more dynamic:

With that copy method, you can put as many values as you want in your constructor, without having to manually copy everything!
